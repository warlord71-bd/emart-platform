## 🔴 OWNER — Do these (workspace/docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-20260605.md)

1. **MailPoet review email** — WooCommerce trigger → Order Completed → 3-day delay → review email
2. **Meta CAPI test** — COD test order → Events Manager: verify Purchase value > 0 + BDT + InitiateCheckout
3. **GSC URL indexing** — 7 URLs listed in OWNER-ACTIONS doc
4. **Cloudflare cache rule** — /shop + /category, 1hr edge TTL
5. **GMC title-risk products** — 11 products in gmc-steps3-6-report-20260605.md, approve/reject title changes
6. **GMC data/asset** — 2 products missing price/image: IDs 63749, 62576
7. **GMC mixed manual** — 6 products: IDs 36262, 3274, 56108, 3753, 38292, 26194
8. **16 product images** — workspace/audit/active/products-need-real-image.csv
9. **pa_concern 1,161 rows** — 13 conservative assignments applied Jun 6 and `tag:products` revalidated; remaining 1,147 left blank due no reliable signal
10. ~~**OpenClaw meta generator**~~ — ✅ resolved Jun 9: process stopped, job complete, 41/42 bad metas fixed
11. **6 "original original" metas** — find `pa_brand`/`pa_origin` Woo taxonomy terms with value "original" and correct them; regenerate those 6 metas after fix
14. **1304-product meta regen (781 missing + 523 bad "original" pattern) — IN PROGRESS** — `meta_generator.py` updated with `--force`/`--ids-file`. Dry-run resumed in background (PID 448966 as of 2026-06-10 01:22 UTC) for the 1266 remaining IDs in `workspace/docs/meta_regen_ids_remaining_20260610.txt`, output → `workspace/audit/active/meta-generator-2026-06-10-resume.log`. First 38 results already done in `workspace/audit/active/meta-generator-2026-06-10-003216.jsonl`. **This is a dry-run only — no DB writes yet.** Next: let it finish, spot-review JSONL output, then re-run WITHOUT `--dry-run` to apply, then revalidate `tag:products` via /api/revalidate.
12. ~~**Product duplicate review**~~ — ✅ resolved Jun 9: redirects deployed first, 12 retire products set to `draft`; manually purge the 12 old URLs listed in `workspace/audit/active/duplicate-resolution-recommendations-20260609.md` if Cloudflare still serves stale old PDP HTML
13. **Image/duplicate follow-up** — final browser-ranked list ready at `workspace/audit/active/combined-image-duplicate-browser-final-20260609.md`; 33 Level A likely image/action items need source-image approval before changes

## 🟢 CLAUDE — Next tasks (2026-06-10)

### C1 — Blog generator: rewritten, tested, READY TO RUN (not scheduled)
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace-emart/blog_generator.py` fully rewritten: GSC-informed + evergreen topic bank, 5 rotating writer personas, anti-AI-detection prompt rules (no separate humanizer pass), in-content internal auto-linking (`/ingredients/*`, `/concerns/*`, `/category/*`), always-attach featured product image, OpenRouter model list fixed to working free models.
- ✅ Live test passed: published post 93922 "Innisfree Skincare Guide for Bangladesh" (https://e-mart.com.bd/blog/innisfree-skincare-guide-for-bangladesh-volcanic-clay-mask-face-wash-sunscreen) via `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` fallback. State file updated (`gsc_used_indices: [0]`, `persona_index: 1`).
- **Per owner instruction "meta first, blog next" — do NOT run again or add cron until item #14 (meta regen) has progressed/completed** (shared OpenRouter free-tier quota). Suggested cron once cleared: `0 2,10,18 * * *` (3x/day).

### C2 — Schema/social sameAs — ✅ DONE 2026-06-10
- Added `COMPANY.social.tiktok` to Organization `sameAs` in `layout.tsx`. Built on Local + VPS, `pm2 restart emartweb` done, live smoke HTTP 200, live JSON-LD confirmed includes `https://www.tiktok.com/@emart_bdofficial`. Committed `806938f`, pushed to `origin/main`, VPS git aligned to `806938f`.
- Reddit/LinkedIn `sameAs`: still blocked — no profile URLs exist in `companyProfile.ts`; need owner to provide real URLs before adding (cannot fabricate URLs).

### C3 — Strategic SEO note (owed, not yet written up)
- Owner asked for a synthesis on: Android default search engine (Google) dominance in Bangladesh + mobile-first SEO implications, how AI/LLM search surfaces (AI Overviews, ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini) consume schema/FAQ content for citations, and factoring TikTok/Facebook/YouTube trending topics into blog topic selection. Not yet delivered — schema audit groundwork done (homepage/category schema confirmed mostly correct).

### C4 — GEO/AEO standing consideration (added 2026-06-10)
- Owner: keep Generative Engine Optimization (AI Overviews/ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini citations) and Answer Engine Optimization (featured snippets/PAA/voice, FAQPage schema) in mind for ALL future SEO/content work, not a one-off task. Documented in `workspace/SEO_MASTER.md` under "STANDING CONSIDERATION — GEO & AEO". New content types (blog, future `/best/*`, `/compare/*`) should ship with `Article`/`FAQPage`/`HowTo` schema from the start.

### C5 — 14-item SEO/frontend audit — Phase 1-4 done for approved batch 2026-06-10
- Verified all 14 items (A1, B2-B6, C7-C11, D12-D14) with file:line references. Several were already resolved/stale: A1 (Pixel ID `763041131179021` confirmed correct, env var present), B2 (dead `ShopByCategorySection` — removed as cleanup), C10 meta-description part (contact page already has one), D12 (blog Article JSON-LD + byline already implemented).
- **Fixed & deployed** (commits `d82b421`, `b8eba66`, `508beef`, `c08de32`, pushed to `origin/main`): B6 twitter:site `@emartbd`→`@emartskincarebd`; C11 robots.txt CCBot disallow→allow; B2 dead-code removal; C9 sitemap lastmod split (catalog-reflecting pages get fresh generation-time date, static policy pages omit lastmod instead of frozen `2026-05-16`). Built, `pm2 restart emartweb`, live smoke verified (note: edge cache served stale `@emartbd` briefly — origin confirmed correct).
- **B3 — DONE 2026-06-10 (data task, no code/slug/URL change)**: WC category `night-cream` (id 3601, slug unchanged) renamed to "Moisturizers". Additively assigned category 3601 to: (1) all 27 `cream-moisturizer` products, then (2) 120 more standalone face moisturizer creams/gel-creams/lotions found across the full 3,626-product catalog (criteria: cream/gel cream/moisturizer/facial lotion only/night cream — excluded body lotion, baby, sunscreen-primary, masks, toners, serums, cleansers, lip/hair). Existing category memberships kept (additive only). Result: "Moisturizers" homepage card now shows **162 products** (was 15), `tag:products`+`tag:categories` revalidated, live-verified. Note: `/category/night-cream` page `<title>`/meta still shows old Rank Math "Night Cream Prices in Bangladesh" text — this is a 1hr `next: {revalidate:3600}` GraphQL fetch cache (not tag-based) and will self-update within an hour as it now reads the renamed term name "Moisturizers".
- **B5/C7/C8 — DONE 2026-06-10** (commits `592b1eb`, `3c909d1`, `f61a3f5`, pushed to `origin/main`, VPS git aligned): B5 added `data-nosnippet` to the hidden-on-desktop mobile hero copy span in `HeroCarousel.tsx`. C7 removed the broken `other['og:type']` (rendered as `<meta name="og:type">`, invisible to OG parsers) and added a raw `<meta property="og:type" content="product" />` directly in `shop/[slug]/page.tsx` JSX — confirmed Next 14's typed `openGraph.type` union has no `'product'` value and would throw at runtime if cast, so the metadata-API route wasn't viable. C8 added a `withDhakaOffset()` helper in `wordpress-posts.ts` so blog `date`/`modified` (site-local Asia/Dhaka, UTC+6, no DST) get a `+06:00` suffix before feeding `datePublished`/`dateModified` JSON-LD. All three built/lint/typechecked clean on Local, VPS build + `pm2 restart emartweb` clean, live-verified (`og:type=product` meta present once, hero `data-nosnippet` present, blog JSON-LD dates show `+06:00`).
- **C10 remainder/D13/D14 — DONE 2026-06-10 by Codex** (commits `fc47ea6`, `20adebf`, `d850d4a`, pushed to `origin/main`; VPS git realigned to `edb6927`, build+`pm2 restart emartweb` already done): C10 added `data-nosnippet` to header marquee/cart-preview duplicate text. D13 added `ProductEducationLinks` component — PDP ingredient/skin-concern links to `/ingredients/*` and `/concerns/*` (live-verified on COSRX snail essence PDP). D14 added `NumberedPagination` shared component on `/shop` and `/category/[slug]` (live-verified `/shop?page=2` shows 152 total pages with prev/next + numbered links). 14-item audit (A1, B2-B6, C7-C11, D12-D14) is now fully closed. B4 (hero raw `<img>`→`next/image`) remains deferred as a separate LCP-sensitive task, not assigned.

## 🔑 Key Rules

**WC API Key:** key_id `39` ("Emart BFF Live") in `.env.local`. Never delete without updating .env.local first.
**Freeze:** Structural/nav frozen until 2026-07-03. Content, data, new features, automation: OK.
**Deploy order:** Local build → commit → rsync → VPS build → pm2 restart → smoke test → push.
**Humanizer priority:** Always by GSC impression count, not category order.
**GMC sync:** Always last — after all description fixes verified.
